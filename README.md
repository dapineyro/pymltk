This package is a collection of classes and functions designed to be helpful
for machine learning development. It is largely dependent on scikit-learn,
pandas and numpy, as well as many other packages. It was initially meant to
handle DNA methylation data and use it for machine learning, but can be used
for many different projects with similar data (a matrix of features as rows
and samples as columns, in which all values are in 0-1 range).
